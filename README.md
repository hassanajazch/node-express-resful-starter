Everyone can collaborate with this project just fork and push changes back.

What use this Starter App?
---------

 - **Clustering mode** for load many forks depending of the CPU's units.
 - READY to upload for **ElasticBeanstalk** on AWS (tested).
 - **JWT** for protect routes.
 - **Promises** to handle async request.
 - **Sequalize** for ORM.
 - **Mocha and Chai** for testing.

/test (The test files for BDD)
/utils
	autoload.js (Script file for autoload specifics files)
config.json (Config file for the app)

------------

When execute any of this commands the app start with clustering, creating many cluster apps depending of the numbers of CPU's your computer had.

*development*
------------

In Development mode the express app is starter with nodemon for automatic refresh when do changes.

*production*
------------

<code>npm start</code>
